<h2>What Makes Us Unique?</h2>
<p style="color: gray; text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">One travel expert throughout
Many agencies force you to deal with multiple people throughout the booking process, making it disjointed and impersonal. At Crystal Travel you will deal with the same travel expert from the moment of initial contact until you are safely back at home. 
</p>
<h2>We offer flights</h2>
<p style="color: gray; text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">
When booking a vacation, it is always better value to book an air-inclusive packages. Many travel agencies are unable to offer this. Crystal Travel & Tours works with most all international airlines and  frequently offers the most competitive fares for travel to Ireland,Britain and Europe.
</p>
<h2>Visit us in person</h2>
<p style="color: gray; text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">Unlike many other agencies who do their business solely online or even from abroad, we still keep regular office hours and are delighted when with planned visits or drop-ins to our West Roxbury office.
</p>
<h2>Quality is our focus</h2>
<p style="color: gray; text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">We insist on prompt and pleasant customer service and the best hotels, visitor attractions and entertainment. By sharing with you the hidden places not mentioned in guidebooks, the local people you wouldnâ€™t otherwise meet and the traditions you may not have experienced by yourself, we ensure that you get an authentic and enhanced experience you simply could not have had on your own.</p>
